# ZigZag

ZigZag is a GUI program that allows to test the algorithm of scanning a given polygon in a zig-zag manner.

The user first clicks the points that form the polygon and then clicks on the button "Enviar Mision" and the polygon is drawn in black and the path in red. The path will sweep the area in lines that are parallel to the 1-2 side and travell across the other sides making sure the whole area is swept.

This was part of a bigger project called Termodron where a drone swept an area looking for a hot-spot with a thermal camera.
